        <h3> How Rounds Work </h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>
                In the experiment, you will work with Points. At the end of the experiment, Points will be converted to Dollars.  Todayâ€™s exchange rate is {{ exRate }} Points = $1
            </li>
            <li>
                The experiment is made up of {{ Rounds }} <b>Rounds</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each round will last for a random number of <b>Periods</b>:
                <ul style="text-align: left;">
                    <li>
                        At the end of each period the computer will generate a random number between 1 and {{ dieN }} ({1, 2,..., {{ dieN }}}) with each number being equally likely.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the computer generates a number less than {{ thres }}, then the <b>Round continues</b> for at least one more period (<b>{{ contProb }}% Probability</b>).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the computer generates a number equal to {{ thres }} or greater, then the <b>Round ends</b> (<b>{{ endProb }}% Probability</b>).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                In each period of a round you will participate in two games <div class="redbox">Red Game</div> and <div class="bluebox">Blue Game</div> simultaneously. You will participate in each game with a different participant.
            </li>
            <li>
                At the start of each round, you will be paired with <b>two other randomly chosen participants</b>, one for <div class="redbox">Red Game</div> and one for <div class="bluebox">Blue Game</div>. We will refer to the participant you will be paired with for <div class="redbox">Red Game</div> as <b>Other Red</b> and the participant you will be paired with for <div class="bluebox">Blue Game</div> as <b>Other Blue</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                You will then participate in <div class="redbox">Red Game</div> and <div class="bluebox">Blue Game</div> simultaneously for a random number of periods with Other Red and Other Blue respectively.
            </li>
            <li>
                What happens when you can not be paired with other participants in a round?
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You will be informed if you could not be paired.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will be allotted {{ expPoints_Red }} points for <div class="redbox">Red Game</div> for each period of that round.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will be allotted {{ expPoints_Blue }} points for <div class="bluebox">Blue Game</div> for each period of that round.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In the next page we will explain what the games are in detail.
