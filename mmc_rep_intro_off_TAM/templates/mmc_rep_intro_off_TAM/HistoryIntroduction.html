        <p>
			The history of all variables in a Round will be recorded in two history tables, one for each Game, like in the figure below. In the following table, you can see an example history of a Round in which the computer picked actions at random.
		</p>
		<h3> History Tables </h3>

		<hr style="clear:both;">
		The recorded variables include:
		<ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px">
			<li>
                Period -- Period number (6 is the current Period number in this example)
            </li>
			<li>
                My Action -- Your action in all the periods in the current round for that game. In this example, in period 2 of <div class="redbox">Red Game</div> your action is <div class="abox">A</div>.
            </li>
			<li>
                Other's Action -- Action of Other in every period of the current round for that game. In this example, in period 3, Other's action is <div class="bbox">B</div> in <div class="redbox">Red Game</div>. In period 4, Other's action is <div class="Ybox">Y</div> in <div class="bluebox">Blue Game</div>.
            </li>
			<li>
                My Points -- Your points in each period of the current round for that game. 
            </li>
			<li>
                Other's Points -- Points received by Other in each period of the current round for that game.
            </li>
			<li>
                Number -- Random number generated by the computer at the end of the period to decide if the round continues for another period. A random number is drawn from {1,2,..., {{ dieN }}} with each number being equally likely.
            </li>
		</ul>
		<div>
			There are ?s for "My Action", "Other's Action", "My Points", and "Other's Points" in Period 6 because that period is in progress in this example.
