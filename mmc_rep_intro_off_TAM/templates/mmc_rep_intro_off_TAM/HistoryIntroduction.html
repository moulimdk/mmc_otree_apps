        <h3>How History is Recorded and Displayed</h3>
		<p>
			 The history of all variables in a Round will be recorded in two history tables, like in the figure below. In the following table, you can see an example history of a Round in which the computer picked actions at random.
		</p>
		<h3> History Tables </h3>
		{% include 'mmc_rep_intro_off_TAM/HistoryTableExample.html' %}
		<hr style="clear:both;">
		The recorded variables include:
		<ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px">
			<li>
                Period -- Period number (6 is the current Period number in this example)
            </li>
			<li>
                My Action -- Your action in all the periods in the current round for that game (either <div class="abox">A</div> or <div class="bbox">B</div> in <div class="redbox">Game R</div>; either <div class="Wbox">W</div> or <div class="Ybox">Y</div> in <div class="bluebox">Game B</div>). In this example, in period 2 of <div class="redbox">Game R</div> your action is <div class="abox">A</div>.
            </li>
			<li>
                Other's Action -- Action of Other (the participant you are paired with for this round) in every period of the current round. In this example, in period 3, Other's action is <div class="bbox">B</div> in <div class="redbox">Red Game</div>. In period 4, Other's action is <div class="Ybox">Y</div> in <div class="bluebox">Blue Game</div>.
            </li>
			<li>
                My Points -- Your points in each period of the current round for that game. 
            </li>
			<li>
                Other's Points -- Points received by Other (the participant you are paired with for this round) in each period of the current round for that game.
            </li>
			<li>
                Number -- Random number generated by the computer at the end of the period to decide if the round continues for another period. A random number is drawn from {1,2,..., {{ dieN }}} with each number being equally likely.
            </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
            There are ?s for "My Action", "Other's Action", "My Points", and "Other's Points" in Period 6 in both <div class="redbox">Red Game</div> and <div class="bluebox">Blue Game</div> because that period is in progress in this example.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next page we will explain how you will choose your actions in the each period.
