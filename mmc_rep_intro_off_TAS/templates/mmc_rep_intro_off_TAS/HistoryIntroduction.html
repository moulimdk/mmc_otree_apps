        <p>
			The history of all variables in a Round will be recorded in two history tables, one for each Game, like in the figure below. In the following table, you can see an example history of a Round in which the computer picked actions at random.
		</p>
		<h3>History Tables</h3>
		{% include 'mmc_rep_intro_off_TAS/HistoryTableExample.html' %}
		<hr style="clear:both;">
		The recorded variables include:
		<ul style="text-align: left;">
			<li>
				Period -- Period number (6 is the current Period number in this example)
			</li>
			<li>
				My Action -- Your action in every period of the current round for that game. In this example, in period 2 of <div class="redbox">Red Game</div> your action is <div class="abox">A</div>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Other Red's Action -- Action of Other Red in every period of the current round. In this example, in period 3, Other Red's action is <div class="bbox">B</div>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Other Blue's Action -- Action of Other Blue in every period of the current round. In this example, in period 4, Other Blue's action is <div class="Ybox">Y</div>.
			</li>
            <li>
            	My Points -- Your points in each period of the current round for that game.
            </li>
			<li>
				Other Red's Points -- Points received by Other Red in each period of the current round in <div class="redbox">Red Game</div>.
			</li>
            <li>
            	Other Blue's Points -- Points received by Other Blue in each period of the current round in <div class="bluebox">Blue Game</div>.
            </li>
			<li>
				Number -- Random number generated by the computer at the end of the period to decide if the round continues for another period. A random number is drawn from {1,2,..., {{ dieN }}} with each number being equally likely.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			There are ?s for "My Action", "Other Red's Action", "Other Blue's Action", "My Points", "Other Red's Points", and "Other Blue's Points" in Period 6 because that period is in progress in this example.
